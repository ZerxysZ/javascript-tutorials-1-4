                Mr Raj Rai, one of the best teachers to ever exist. 
                A wise individual who has been persevering the qualities 
                of life for about about a decade. Mr Rai
                is the reincarnation of Dwayne the Rock Johnson, 
                they're both wise and admirable individuals. 
                Mr Rai loves to go rock climbing, he loves to program as a hobby,
                he loves to read books and is the only teacher 
                I could sincerely call a friend. Yes, I shouldn't 
                identify Mr Rai as a teacher. I oftenly come up to him and chat about 
                everyday life priorities, Mr Rai is my friend. 
                A good friend if i say so myself. If you're reading 
                this message Mr Rai, you are seriously the best teacher I could ask for,
                since this is my last assignment I will hopefully 
                see you in programming 12 next year to further elevate my programming skills. 
                Until then, I will continue to visit you oftenly 
                even when my second semester starts, all because you're my friend.

                During my sophomore year of high school, 
                we were doing silent work and my history 
                teacher said that we could listen to music but 
                if it was too loud he would “break our headphones.” 
                so I’m doing my work quietly with my music on low, and this obnoxious kid 
                sitting next to me had his music really loud. I could hear 
                it over my music but ignored it. My teacher thought it was me. 
                So he comes up to me & ripped my BRAND NEW Apple headphones, 
                looking ruthless. He suddenly realized it was the guy next to me and he was completely embarrassed. 
                He came in the next day with a new pair and an apology note taped to them. 
                He couldn't look me in the eye for the rest of the year.

                The characters that are drived from fiction and 
                imagination consist of many different 
                forms of character traits. They can have characteristics 
                of courage, cleverness, strength, power, loyalty 
                and other characteristics that make up him or her 
                as a super hero, but the characteristics that he or she 
                possesses will make him look masculine or feminine. 
                The character I will be describing is Goku, a main 
                character from a great cartoon Dragon Ball. 
                Like Superman, he is from another planet sent by his father 
                to Earth because his planet Vegita was destroyed. 
                Goku is different from the people on Earth because he has 
                extraordinary powers like Superman. He can fly, move mountains, 
                run at a blitzing speed and has many other powers 
                that puts him in a different class from the people on Earth. 
                The characteristics that he embodies are undeniably a 
                man's feature which he uses to save people's lives and use for the good of the people.
